# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, created with Vue.js.

**Note:** Yes, I know the webpack template used here is probably overkill for the purposes of this site, but it lends itself to quick and easy prototyping because of my familiarity with it.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
