    <p>
      The Trust & Safety Engineering team aims to make Freelancer.com a safe marketplace
      for freelancers and employers to work in. In order for a marketplace like Freelancer to work,
      we have to ensure that users trust on the <i>platform</i> as well as the <i>users</i>
      they will be interacting with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trust</strong> is an abstract concept that has a wide scope of problems; from firefighting urgent
      fraud attacks, spam, and chargebacks, to implementing long-term solutions to increase user verification
      and encourage good work behavior on the site. The problem is ever-evolving so there’s always something
      new and interesting. Priorities change rapidly depending on immediate needs, but the goal is always to
      provide a reliable and professional experience to our users.

    <p>
      For almost two years, I have worked with a team of engineers, QA, product manager, and data scientist
      in improving the Trust and Safety of the Freelancer platform. The broad scope of our product allows
      us to collaborate with a myriad of teams, especially with Payments and Security. My role as an engineer
      is to implement solutions designed to prevent fraud and increase Trust in the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s hard to measure Trust, and even harder to implement long-term solutions to increase Trust.
      By nature, our solutions add friction to our users’ workflow, so we often experiment with <strong>balancing
      security needs and improving user experience</strong> through A/B testing. We want our solutions to be effective
      yet as non-intrusive as possible. We also work with customer support in ensuring they have the necessary tools
      to help users solve their problems and achieve their goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working with T&S has taught me a lot about <strong>refactoring and working with a legacy codebase</strong>.
      Because of the ad-hoc nature of the problem, we often have to <strong>re-prioritize our efforts and respond to
      rapid changes</strong> in the site. While we do not have complete control over fraudulent actors, I have found
      that communicating clearly with our users and maintaining good UX is key to controlling Trust in the platform.
      This can be done by emphasizing <strong>clarity</strong> on the status of the user and their work at any point
      in time, as well as communicating what is considered good behavior on the site.
